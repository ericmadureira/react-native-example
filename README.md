# To-do List

This is a to-do list made with React Native and bootstraped with expo-cli. It was made for learning purpose and I've followed no tutorials, just replicated my previous React (web) experience.

## How to run
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `yarn` to install all dependencies
3. Run `yarn start` and follow these [instructions](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/) to see the app

## Tech stack
- React-Native
- Expo-CLI
